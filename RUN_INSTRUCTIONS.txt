# How to Run the AI Personal Finance Assistant Project

This project consists of two main components:
1. **Backend**: A Python FastAPI application located in the `AIworkshop2` directory.
2. **Frontend**: A React Native (Expo) application located in the `FinanceAssistantUI` directory.

You will need two separate terminal windows to run both simultaneously.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed.
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- **Expo CLI** (optional, mostly handled by npx).

---

## 1. Setting up and Running the Backend

The backend handles the API logic and database connections.

1.  **Open a terminal** and navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd AIworkshop2
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (Recommended):
    - **Windows**:
        ```powershell
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - **Mac/Linux**:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies**:
    Install all required packages using the newly created `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Start the FastAPI server using `uvicorn` (with host 0.0.0.0 to allow mobile connection):
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0
    ```
    The server should start running at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

## 2. Setting up and Running the Frontend

The frontend is the mobile application interface.

1.  **Open a NEW terminal** and navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd FinanceAssistantUI
    ```

2.  **Install Node Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Expo Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

4.  **Launch the App**:
    - **Physical Device**: Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal with the **Expo Go** app (Android/iOS).
    - **Android Emulator**: Press `a` in the terminal.
    - **iOS Simulator**: Press `i` in the terminal (Mac only).
    - **Web**: Press `w` to run in the browser.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Backend Connection**: Ensure the frontend knows where the backend is running. If you are testing on a physical device, `localhost` (127.0.0.1) will not work. You may need to update the API base URL in the frontend code to your computer's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).
-   **Firebase Key**: The backend requires `serviceAccountKey.json`. Ensure this file exists in the `AIworkshop2` directory.
